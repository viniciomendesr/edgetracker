# Architecture Decision Records

Format: [ADR by Michael Nygard](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) — the most widely adopted ADR template in open source projects.

Each ADR documents a single architectural decision with its context, rationale, and consequences.

## Status definitions

- **Accepted** — Decision is in effect
- **Superseded by [ADR-XXX]** — Replaced by a newer decision
- **Deprecated** — No longer relevant but kept for historical reference

## Index

Numbers are permanent identifiers, so the table is ordered by number and not by date. ADR-017 is dated 2026-04-22 because it was renumbered from 012 to resolve a collision.
